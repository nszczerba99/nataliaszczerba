- title: Revisiting podcast issues
  desc: Users encountered difficulties navigating back to podcasts,
        as there was no way to group them in the Library. Moreover, returning to a specific episode,
        especially if it wasn't the latest one, was inconvenient and often required scrolling
        through numerous episodes to find the right one.

- title: Chaotic places
  desc: Both the Library and Home tabs were perceived as chaotic by users,
        with too much content crammed in. For the Home tab, users felt there were too many sections
        with no way to remove or customize them. Additionally, podcasts and music were mixed together,
        while users preferred them to be separate.

- title: Liked Songs confusion
  desc: Various users used the Liked Songs playlist differently, with some not using it at all,
        others using it as a catch-all for unsorted songs, and some storing all their songs there.
        For those with many songs, the layout felt problematic as it lacked organization options
        like sorting by artist, album, or genre.

- title: Bad recommendations
  desc: Users criticized the poor music recommendations, especially in the Daily Mixes section.
        They also desired an easier way to exclude specific artists from recommendations.
        Additionally, there was no section for podcast recommendations at all.
