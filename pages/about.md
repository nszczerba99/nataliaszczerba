# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Currently, I work as a Software Engineer, with a particular passion for the frontend aspect. I've always been interested in visual experiences and their impact on users. Recently, I have been deeply immersed in UX Design, learning how to enhance user interaction and satisfaction through thoughtful design process.

I believe my engineering background gives me a unique perspective on UX design and enables me to better understand and collaborate with engineering teams that UX designers so frequently work together with.
